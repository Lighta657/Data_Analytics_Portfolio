                                                DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO
                                                
                    
Examples in this portfolio include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), deployed Machine Learning algorithms, and Findings/Lessons Learned Reports.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning were performed using either Python (Jupyter Notebook) or R (RStudio - please see Rmd files). 

Based on EDA findings, supervised ML algorithms (CART, Gradient Boosting, SVM, KNN, etc) were deployed. Predictions were made using the algorithm with the optimal performance metrics. 

Basket Analysis used Apriori algorithm in R. This is the example of unsupervised ML (no training/testing involved).

AWS Sentiment Predictions for Iphone and Samsung Galaxy project used Amazon Elastic MapReduce clusters to collect sentiments for several types of smartphones from Common Crawl wet files. 

Tweet mining project used MS Azure Databricks platform to perform text mining EDA and ML (Natural Language Processing) for a large tweet data set.
