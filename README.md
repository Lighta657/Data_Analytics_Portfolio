                                                DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIO
                                                
                    
Examples in this portfolio include samples of raw data (some files are too large to download), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), deployed Machine Learning algorithms, Lessons Learned Reports, and Findings Reports.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning were performed using either Python (Jupyter Notebook) or R (RStudio). 

Amazon Elastic MapReduce clusters were used to collect sentiments for several types of smartphones from Common Crawl data. MS Azure Databricks platform was used to perform text mining EDA and ML for a large tweet data set.
