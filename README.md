Examples in this portfolio include samples of raw data (some files are too large to download), Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), deployed Machine Learning algorithms, and Findings Reports/Lessons Learned Reports.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning were performed using either Python (Jupyter Notebook) or R Markdown (Rmd). 

AWS Sentiment Predictions for Iphone and Samsung Galaxy project used Amazon Elastic MapReduce clusters to collect sentiments for several types of smartphones from Common Crawl data.
